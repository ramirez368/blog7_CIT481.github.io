## Cortex reimagines SecOps to stop successful attacks: 
## What is XDR?
Extended detection and response or XDR is a new approach to threat detection and response that provides holistic protection against cyberattacks, unauthorized access and misuse. Coined by Nir Zuk, Palo Alto Networks CTO, in 2018, XDR breaks down traditional security silos to deliver detection and response across all data sources.

According to analyst firm Gartner, XDR is “a SaaS-based, vendor-specific, security threat detection and incident response tool that natively integrates multiple security products into a cohesive security operations system.” The definition of XDR from Forrester Research is a bit more expansive:  “The evolution of EDR, which optimizes threat detection, investigation, response, and hunting in real time. XDR unifies security-relevant endpoint detections with telemetry from security and business tools such as network analysis and visibility (NAV), email security, identity and access management, cloud security, and more. It is a cloud-native platform built on big data infrastructure to provide security teams with flexibility, scalability, and opportunities for automation.”
